          <!-- <ul>Tips
              <li>Filtration</li>
                <ul>Combined biological and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate. Filter media can house microbes that mediate nitrification. Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.[60]</ul>
              <li>Check Ph</li>
                <ul>pH is short for the Latin phrase pondus Hydrogenii or the 'weight of Hydrogen'.

                  (often incorrectly labelled the 'potential of Hydrogen' or the 'power of Hydrogen')
                  
                  Commonly said to be a measurement of how much acidic or alkaline water is.</ul>
              <li>Check Nitrates</li>
                <ul>Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which converts to ammonium, in water) and must then either pass through the nitrogen cycle or be removed by passing through zeolite.[67] Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.[65][page needed] In the wild, the vast amount of water surrounding the fish dilutes ammonia and other waste materials. When fish are put into an aquarium, waste can quickly reach toxic concentrations in the enclosed environment unless the tank is cycled to remove waste.</ul>
